# Claude Cowork Guide

An unofficial, safety-first, power-user guide for Claude Cowork (Research Preview).

## What is this?

This repository contains an **Early Look, Rev 2** guide for Claude Cowork — Anthropic’s agent experience for **Claude Desktop (macOS)** that can act on your local files.

It focuses on:

- Threat model first: destructive file operations and prompt injection
- Practical safety habits: isolated workspace, copies (never originals), previews, batch gating, explicit prohibitions
- Execution model overview: VM-based execution, parallel workstreams, long-running tasks, and session continuity constraints
- A one-page **Power User Runbook** (control / audit / recover)
- Prompt templates and practical workflow examples
- References to primary sources (official docs) and clearly-labeled independent analysis
